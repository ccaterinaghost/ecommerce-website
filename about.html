			<h4>(Now for some background information!)</h4>
			<p>Lysithea is a satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by Seth Barnes Nicholson in 1938 at Mount Wilson Observatory and is named after the mythological Lysithea, daughter of Oceanus and one of Zeus' lovers. We were inspired to name our company Lysithea due to its mysterious, mythological history as well as it's extraterrestrial existance. Many of our desings are created by fusing both organic and mathematical elements, calling us to explore our emotional, romantic side as well as our logical sides. Who knew!</p>
